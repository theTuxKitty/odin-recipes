    <p class="recipe-description" >The earliest recorded mac and cheese recipe dates all the way back to 1769 and most likely comes from Northern Europe. In America, we've been enjoying this staple thanks to Thomas Jefferson. After a trip to France, Jefferson just couldn't part with all of the amazing pasta dishes in which he indulged.</p>
