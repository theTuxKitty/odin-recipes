    <p class="recipe-description" > According to legend, pizzas were developed in Naples, Italy when bakers sold excess dough to poor people. The bread developed into one of the earliest pizzas and was decorated with tomatoes, oil, cheese, and anchovies. These pizzas were sold all over Italy because they were cheap, filling, and tasty.
